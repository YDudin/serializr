Description:
    Stubs out a new serializer. Pass the serializer name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are field arguments specifying the exposed serializer's
    JSON object attributes.

    Finally, if --parent option is given, it's used as superclass of the
    created serializer. The default parent is ApplicationSerializer, that you
    can use in the same way ApplicationController: a place for common utilities
    shared between all the serializers.

Example:
    `rails generate serializer User`

        This will create:

            app/serializers/application_serializer.rb
            app/serializers/user_serializer.rb
